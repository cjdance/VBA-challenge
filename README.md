Repository for VBA Homework in Week 2 of Monash Bootcamp

This repository holds the scripting for the VBA Homework, it can be located in both a .txt file and a .vbs file in case of issues loading.

This repository also holds screenshots of the output from the macro which has been run on the documents provided for the homework.

This homework was challenging as someone new to VBA, with the creation of my macro requiring a number of attempts to ensure correct formatting and syntax.

With more practice, I believe I can clean the code up substantially and discover new paths to reach the same output.
